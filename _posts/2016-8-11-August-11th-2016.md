## Winter Is Coming
Today it feels as if winter has already begun in Duisburg. Typical Duisburg overcast sky and a rather chilling wind. While I'm typing this it has begun to rain. Looks like it's going to be 10 more months of winter now. East Bay Area, why did I ever leave you? Today I will just study for my upcoming Logical Design of Digital Systems exam at home. Maybe I wil go to the TSC's International "Stammtisch" at Ocho Burger. TBD.
