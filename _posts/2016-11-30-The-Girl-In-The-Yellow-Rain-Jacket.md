title: The Girl In the Yellow Rain Jacket

##Just posting to post soemthing, 
It was a characteristically bleak winters day in Duisburg, a seemingly endless drizzle of rain accompanied by a cold harsh wind that seemed to cut right down to the flesh.    
A day where the worlds color pallet seemed to have been reduced to nothing but varying shades of gray.
The sun had yet to rise and it was unlikely that it would even consider making an appearance.      
It did not look like the beginning of a day that anyone would want to remember, let alone one that anyone would want to write about. And it may have remained that way if it hadn't been for one particular girl.    
I first noticed the bright yellow color just out of the corner of my eye, it stood out against the sea of muted grays like a single dandelion standing tall in a field of ash.      
And at that moment it was as if the clouds parted and the sun began to shine, I found myself smiling, yet unable to explain why. And as I exited the tram and we walked together up the hill, I began to dread the moment we would part ways.      
I thought about talking to her, thanking her for brightening my day. But as she turned the corner, I continued straight, for I had reluctanctly decided that it was better left to fate.     
As I approached the top of the hill, I took a selfish glance back. But the flower had blown away and the world had returned to gray. And now I cannot forget the girl in the yellow rain jacket.
