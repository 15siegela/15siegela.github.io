title: World of Boxes

We live in a world of distinct, finely defined boxes.
Rigorous categorization is the way we attempt to make sense of this increasingly complex modern world. We have labels for the usual, as well as the unusual.  This is the way our brains understand the world. This effortless categorization of things not only allows for quicker information processing, but also a greater capacity of stored information. Of course it comes at a cost, this being a slight reduction in the retention of significant details . Without these "boxes" our brains would have no chance of processing the sensory onslaught of information that is hurled at us at a seemingly constant basis. There is nothing inherently wrong with using categorization. However problems start to occur when we start to use the boxes to make sense of situations where perhaps pure emotion is better suited. When we explain away the actions of others with logic and reasoning we explain away all that which makes us fundamentally human. If emotions aren't taken into context we might as well be robots computing raw data.
