## Three Colors: Blue

**Quick Review:** a beautfiul movie from the first minute to the last. Pacing is well done with no drawn out moments or unecessary scenes. Casting is exceptional with characters feeling natural and beleivable. The cinematography is masterfully crafted, each scene effortlessly gliding into the next.  This film elicits a powerful and broad emotional response, some moments are profoundly sad while others elicit happines or laughter.

**3.5/4**
