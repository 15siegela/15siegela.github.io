## Three Colors: Blue
**Quick Review:** a beautiful movie from the first minute to the last. Pacing is well done with no drawn-out moments or unnecessary scenes. Casting is exceptional with characters feeling natural and believable. The cinematography is masterfully crafted, each scene effortlessly gliding into the next.  This film elicits a powerful and broad emotional response, some moments are profoundly sad while others elicit happiness or laughter.

**3.5/4**
