## Back From my trip to Frankfurt and Hamburg

I'm strugggling with what content I should put here. Should I treat this site as a typical blog? I don't feel the need to share everything that I'm doing on Facebook or Instagram etc, maybe that's what I should do here. Then the problem becomes how much should I share, afterall this is a public site. Should this be a place for my innermost thoughts and feelings or should it just be for what lies on the surface ie the weather, big events, any interesting news. Then the questions becomes who am I writing for? Just for myself? Do I have an intended audience? Perhaps I will just simply use this site as a place for my future résumé.
