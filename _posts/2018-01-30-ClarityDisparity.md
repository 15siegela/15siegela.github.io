That I failed to be a disparity, that I now see with sudden clarity, it's clear to me. When they ask me "Am I who I want to be?", and then they go on to say I should just be me. Now how can you strive to be someone who you're not and all the while be happy with who you are and what you've got. But that's just what life is, a to-do list someone else wrote, regurgitated information coming from a bored tenured professor's throat. A high school diploma, that's an absolute must, or you'll end up on the streets soon to be caught up in a drug bust. And if you don't want to work for minimum wage, you should probably get a degree. And better get a loan because that certainly ain't free. And then you'll get a job with salary for working yourself to the bone. Scrape together what's left and hopefully one day you'll own the place you call home.
