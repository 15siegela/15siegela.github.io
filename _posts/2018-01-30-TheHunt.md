##The hunt's no fun if the rabbit doesn't run.

See life's about the chase, something's always just up ahead.
We live our whole lives chasing until the chase is dead.
But it's not the rabbit that stops running, no it's the one who hunts instead.
For you'll never catch that which always lies just ahead.
