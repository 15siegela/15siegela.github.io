## Excerpt from "The Pale King"  
  
"I tended to realize again that I wasnâ€™t even really aware of what was going on, most of the time. Like taking the train instead of actually driving yourself somewhere and having to know where you were and make decisions about where to turn. On the train, one can simply space out and ride along, which is what it felt as though I was doing most of the time." - *David Foster Wallace*
