## I Bought Some Books
This morning I spontaneously decided to order some books from a used book store. I'm not patiently waiting for the following books to arrive.    
-Infinite Jest   
-American Psycho    
-A Clockwork Orange   
-The Great Gatsby    
-The Catcher in the Rye   
-In Cold Blood   
-Catch-22
-Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas    
Maybe now I'll finally finish Infninte Jest, as a friend of mine once said, "It's called _Infinite_ Jest for a reason". Looking forward to receivng the forementioned books so I can begin my collection.
